3 - python scripts of read-helper and automated tests

## Reader Plus

### Intro

It contains a bunch of  actions for assistant robots. And it can be kind of plus service for readers.

Lots of simple and repeated actions should be taken to read, like or share articles.  Why should human do such tiring work? There must be some new way leading to better user experience. But I am not the smart one. So I just do it in my way. This is the reason why this project came out and lasted for a not clear time. Hope new ideas and solutions come as soon as possible. Enjoy reading, not clicking and dragging.
